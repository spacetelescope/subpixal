    """
    Find subpixel displacements between one reference cutout and a set of
    four "dithered" cutouts. This is achieved by finding peak position in a
    "supersampled" cross-correlation image obtained by interlacing
    cross-correlation maps of reference cutout with each dithered cutout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ref_image : numpy.ndarray
        Image of a reference cutout.

    image00 : numpy.ndarray
        Image whose displacement relative to reference image needs to be
        computed. It must have same shape as ``ref_image``.

    image10 : numpy.ndarray
        "Same" image as ``image00`` but sampled at a 1/2 pixel displacement
        along the X-axis. It must have same shape as ``ref_image``.

    image01 : numpy.ndarray
        "Same" image as ``image00`` but sampled at a 1/2 pixel displacement
        along the Y-axis. It must have same shape as ``ref_image``.

    image11 : numpy.ndarray
        "Same" image as ``image00`` but sampled at a 1/2 pixel displacement
        along both X-axis and Y-axis. It must have same shape as ``ref_image``.

    Returns
    -------

    dx : float
        Displacement of ``image00`` with regard to ``ref_image`` along the
        X-axis (columns).

    dy : float
        Displacement of ``image00`` with regard to ``ref_image`` along the
        Y-axis (rows).

    icc : numpy.ndarray, Optional
        Interlaced ("supersampled") cross-correlation image. Returned only when
        ``full_output`` is `True`.
